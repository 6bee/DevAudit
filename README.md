devaudit <package-source> [--file <file>]

package-source is one of nuget, msi, chocolatey, bower, oneget.
--file <file>
    For use with **nuget** and **bower** package sources. The file argument
    specifies the dependency file to be processed. For NuGet this would be
    "packages.config" and for bower a "bower.json" file.

2. Click on the [releases](https://github.com/OSSIndex/DevAudit/releases) link near the top of the page
2. Identify the release you would like to install
3. A "DevAudit#.#.#.zip" link should be visible for each release that has release binaries
4. Download the file
5. Unzip into the desired location
6. Add the install directory into your PATH environment variable

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in jQuery before 1.6.3, when using location.hash to select elements, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted tag.

Affected versions: 1.6, 1.6.1, 1.6.2
Selector interpreted as HTML
&num;9521 and &num;6429 and probably others identify specific instances of a general problem: jQuery( strInput ) cannot reliably differentiate selectors from HTML.
?http://jsfiddle.net/C8dgG/
Looking for "<" past the first character creates vulnerabilities and confusing behavior on complex input.
quickExpr should be abandoned in favor of a simpler "parse as HTML if and only if there is a leading less-than" rule, with intentional parsing handled by the jQuery( "<div/>" ).html( strHtml ).contents() pattern.

Affected versions: <1.9.0
[15/16] Microsoft.Data.OData 5.6.3 1 distinct (1 total) known vulnerabilities, 0 affecting installed version.
[16/16] Microsoft.Data.Services.Client 5.6.3 1 distinct (1 total) known vulnerabilities, 0 affecting installed version.
